This fork includes misspelled words (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_misspelled_English_words) and some common British / US English alternative spellings.

You probably just want to grab the update json files in the /lemmas directory.

# ProcessWire Word Tools module 

Currently focused on English language word functions including inflection and 
lemmatisation. Provides a simple API for using these functions. 

Provides the ability to automatically hook into ProcessWire (3.0.162+) to enhance text 
searches that use any operator with a plus in "+" in it, which are the query expansion 
operators. For example, a search query for “fishing boat” …
~~~~~
$pages->find('title~|+=fishing boat');
~~~~~~
…would automatically expand to include all these words: fishing, fished, fishes, fish, 
boat, boats, boating.

Please note the results are not always going to be perfect here, but intended to strike 
a balance between maintainability and accuracy. The goal being to provide potentially 
helpful word additions for ProcessWire-based search engines needing word variations. 

The JSON dictionary files in the ./lemmas/ and ./roots/ directories was 
converted from PHP files in the [Lemmatizer](https://github.com/writecrow/lemmatizer) 
project © 2018 Mark Fullmer.
